##My Reflection on Software development Fundamentals class

In the course Software Development Fundamentals I able to get a know how on Scratch, Github-reseacrch Repository, Python Fundamentals
and pair-programming, Video-graphing, and Agile/software development process, and prototyping with my instructor Roman Mitch and lab assistant Dr. Sarmad Soomro. I like Roman's advice saying,"take regular breaks away from your screen after 50 minutes of using it and stretch your body" and Dr. Sarmad SAID,"you should start coding from the very basic simple steps don't dive from the beginning to make yourself hard". Meanwhile, I noticed that some people should overcome functional fixedness and fixed mindset because their intelligence, talents and personalities are not fixed traits that cannot grow if they continued effort to do or achieve something despite difficulties, failure, or opposition.

When I first saw Roman using the scratch and created responsive sprites to a moving hand and ballons I was surprised how that was possible.
In the first class I have learned about loops, conditionals, variables, operators, sprites and scripts in Scratch(a visual programming language developed at MIT in the states) and created a Welcoming Robot then I embeded it to my reseach respositiry. So that I can edited it any time in the future. This is shown in the link below.

After that I completley dive in to a reseacrch repository and started to create coding in Visual Studio and store it in my github repository. I am very happy to be able to know the github application, its very helpful. I am still getting challenged coding in python (a computer programming language often used to build websites and software, automate tasks, and conduct data analysis. Python is a general-purpose language, meaning it can be used to create a variety of different programs and isn't specialized for any specific problems.), thanks to my teachers I will keep on learning by coding.
