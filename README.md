##My Reflection on Software development Fundamentals class


Before this study in IT I have completed a college in Tourism Managment. Now I am trying to change my career as Tourism is affected by Covid 19 and also working from home is becoming popular now a days. 
In the course Software Development Fundamentals I able to get a know how on Scratch, Github-reseacrch Repository, Python Fundamentals
and pair-programming, Video-graphing, and Agile/software development process, and prototyping with my instructor Roman Mitch and lab assistant Dr. Sarmad Soomro. I like Roman's advice saying,"take regular breaks away from your screen after 50 minutes of using it and stretch your body" and Dr. Sarmad SAID,"you should start coding from the very basic simple steps don't dive from the beginning to make yourself hard". Meanwhile, I noticed that some people should overcome functional fixedness and fixed mindset because their intelligence, talents and personalities are not fixed traits that cannot grow if they continued effort to do or achieve something despite difficulties, failure, or opposition. Here time management is very important technique that limits a task to a fixed (but realistic) timeline that may be minutes, hours, days, or even weeks long, depending on the task complexity.

 When I first saw Roman using the scratch and created responsive sprites to a moving hand and ballons I was surprised how that was possible.
In the first class I have learned about loops, conditionals, variables, operators, sprites and scripts in Scratch(a visual programming language developed at MIT in the states) and created a Welcoming Robot then I embeded it to my reseach respositiry. So that I can edited it any time in the future. This is shown in the link below.

After that I am now and then working on a reseacrch repository and started to create coding in Visual Studio and store it in my github repository. I am very happy to be able to know the github application, its very helpful and now I am a bit confident on how to use it and proud of my slef. I am still getting challenged coding in python (a computer programming language often used to build websites and software, automate tasks, and conduct data analysis. Python is a general-purpose language, meaning it can be used to create a variety of different programs and isn't specialized for any specific problems.), thanks to my teachers I will keep on learning by coding. My lab teacher showed me what and how to use variables: a named container for a particular set of bits or type of data (like integer, float, string etc...).  Forexample, x = 5​ y = "John"​ print(x)​ print(y). So in this context x and y are variables which are subject to change when required. Along with this on my computer lab I participated on Video-graph: were 5 of my classmates gather each with a mobile phone and each of us started recording a video at the same time by framing one other person in our video the recording ends when one of us leave one of the frames then we Watched the videos together, later each of us placed our phone on the floor and pressed play,and then step back. Finally, I was assigned to record the video playing and posted it to the teams as bellow. I really liked and enjoyed it.

On Marshmallow Challenge I learnt team work and how software prototype can be developed. This lab helped me to investigate how softwares are integrated and work to ease life of human. The image bellow reflects what we did as group in the class using marshmallow, pasta, string and packing tape.
