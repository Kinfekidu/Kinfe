##My Reflection on Software development Fundamentals class


Before this study in IT I have completed a college in Tourism Managment. Now I am trying to change my career as Tourism is affected by Covid 19 and also working from home is becoming popular now a days. 
In the course Software Development Fundamentals I able to get a know how on Scratch, Github-reseacrch Repository, Python Fundamentals
and pair-programming, Video-graphing, and Agile/software development process, and prototyping with my instructor Roman Mitch and lab assistant Dr. Sarmad Soomro. I like Roman's advice saying,"take regular breaks away from your screen after 50 minutes of using it and stretch your body" and Dr. Sarmad SAID,"you should start coding from the very basic simple steps don't dive from the beginning to make yourself hard". Meanwhile, I noticed that some people should overcome functional fixedness and fixed mindset because their intelligence, talents and personalities are not fixed traits that cannot grow if they continued effort to do or achieve something despite difficulties, failure, or opposition. Here time management is very important technique that limits a task to a fixed (but realistic) timeline that may be minutes, hours, days, or even weeks long, depending on the task complexity. Furthermore, meditation also found to be helpful for me as meditation can give me a sense of calm, peace and balance that can benefit both my emotional well-being and my overall health. I also use it to relax and cope with stress by refocusing my attention on something calming. Meditation helped me learn to stay centered and keep inner peace. Inaddtion to this, I have ability to continuing in a course of action despite difficulty or delay in achieving success. I have developed this from my backhome lifestyle.  I think I have a sense of mindfulness in maintaining a moment-by-moment awareness of our thoughts, feelings, bodily sensations, and surrounding environment, through a gentle, nurturing lens.

 When I first saw Roman using the scratch and created responsive sprites to a moving hand and ballons I was surprised how that was possible.
In the first class I have learned about loops, conditionals, variables, operators, sprites and scripts in Scratch(a visual programming language developed at MIT in the states) and created a Welcoming Robot then I embeded it to my reseach respositiry. So that I can edited it any time in the future. So for me my scratch coding is just  a MVP bacuse if it get an acceptance and its useful it will be developed in to a further sophisticated coding if not it will be left as its. A minimum viable product (MVP) is a version of a product with just enough features to be usable by early customers who can then provide feedback for future product development. A focus on releasing an MVP means that developers potentially avoid lengthy and (ultimately) unnecessary work. Instead, they iterate on working versions and respond to feedback, challenging and validating assumptions about a product's requirements. I will use the concept of MVP to teach my kids in the future. Moreover, I will also use scratch to teach others in programming language as its easy for understanding. Thus,the link attached bellow can lead you to my work in scratch.

After that I am now and then working on a reseacrch repository and started to create coding in Visual Studio and store it in my github repository. I am very happy to be able to know the github application, its very helpful and now I am a bit confident on how to use it and proud of my slef. I am still getting challenged coding in python (a computer programming language often used to build websites and software, automate tasks, and conduct data analysis. Python is a general-purpose language, meaning it can be used to create a variety of different programs and isn't specialized for any specific problems.), thanks to my teachers I will keep on learning by coding though its seems hard feel doubtful for me. My lab teacher showed me what and how to use variables: a named container for a particular set of bits or type of data (like integer, float, string etc...).  Forexample, x = 5​ y = "John"​ print(x)​ print(y). So in this context x and y are variables which are subject to change when required. In the future I keep on using python to code as many people recommend it the good for beginners. Along with this on my computer lab I participated on Video-graph: were 5 of my classmates gather each with a mobile phone and each of us started recording a video at the same time by framing one other person in our video the recording ends when one of us leave one of the frames then we Watched the videos together, later each of us placed our phone on the floor and pressed play,and then step back. Finally, I was assigned to record the video playing and posted it to the teams as bellow. I really liked and enjoyed it.

On Marshmallow Challenge I learnt team work and how software prototype can be developed. This lab helped me to investigate and know the advantage of collaboration in creating new system as every group member will bring a different theory or idea of how the construction should be made. To achieve the best structure, more hands are better in maintaining the integrity of the structure and make life simple. Rather than working alone.  The image bellow reflects what we did as group in the class using marshmallow, 20 pasta, 1 metere string and 1 mtere packing tape in 18 minute time limit.

During my BigBlueButton video class, I coded using python koan on Visual Studio and experienced pair programming (an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently. While reviewing, the observer also considers the "strategic" direction of the work, coming up with ideas for improvements and likely future problems to address. This is intended to free the driver to focus all of their attention on the "tactical" aspects of completing the current task, using the observer as a safety net and guide.
