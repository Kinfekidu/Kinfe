##My Reflection on Software development Fundamentals class


Before this study in IT I have completed a college in Tourism Managment. Now I am trying to change my career as Tourism is affected by Covid 19 and also working from home is becoming popular now a days. 
In the course Software Development Fundamentals I able to get a know how on Scratch, Github-reseacrch Repository, Python Fundamentals
and pair-programming, Video-graphing, and Agile/software development process, and prototyping with my instructor Roman Mitch and lab assistant Dr. Sarmad Soomro. I like Roman's advice saying,"take regular breaks away from your screen after 50 minutes of using it and stretch your body" and Dr. Sarmad SAID,"you should start coding from the very basic simple steps don't dive from the beginning to make yourself hard". Meanwhile, I noticed that some people should overcome functional fixedness and fixed mindset because their intelligence, talents and personalities are not fixed traits that cannot grow if they continued effort to do or achieve something despite difficulties, failure, or opposition. Here time management is very important technique that limits a task to a fixed (but realistic) timeline that may be minutes, hours, days, or even weeks long, depending on the task complexity. Furthermore, meditation also found to be helpful for me as meditation can give me a sense of calm, peace and balance that can benefit both my emotional well-being and my overall health. I also use it to relax and cope with stress by refocusing my attention on something calming. Meditation helped me learn to stay centered and keep inner peace. Inaddtion to this, I have ability to continuing in a course of action despite difficulty or delay in achieving success. I have developed this from my backhome lifestyle.  I think I have a sense of mindfulness in maintaining a moment-by-moment awareness of our thoughts, feelings, bodily sensations, and surrounding environment, through a gentle, nurturing lens and Conscious listening being intentionally present during communication between myself and anothers while being aware of my self and the other's feelings and needs.

 When I first saw Roman using the scratch and created responsive sprites to a moving hand and ballons I was surprised how that was possible.
In the first class I have learned about loops, conditionals, variables, operators, sprites and scripts in Scratch(a visual programming language developed at MIT in the states) and created a Welcoming Robot then I embeded it to my reseach respositiry. So that I can edited it any time in the future. So for me my scratch coding is just  a MVP bacuse if it get an acceptance and its useful it will be developed in to a further sophisticated coding if not it will be left as its. A minimum viable product (MVP) is a version of a product with just enough features to be usable by early customers who can then provide feedback for future product development. A focus on releasing an MVP means that developers potentially avoid lengthy and (ultimately) unnecessary work. Instead, they iterate on working versions and respond to feedback, challenging and validating assumptions about a product's requirements. I will use the concept of MVP to teach my kids in the future meaning when they create some findings to realise it interms of helping or easing life or solving problem either in the present or future life. Moreover, I will also use scratch to teach others in programming language as its easy for understanding. Thus,the link attached bellow can lead you to my work in scratch.

After that I am now and then working on a reseacrch repository and started to create coding in Visual Studio and store it in my github repository. I am very happy to be able to know the github application, its very helpful and now I am a bit confident on how to use it and proud of my slef. I am still getting challenged coding in python (a computer programming language often used to build websites and software, automate tasks, and conduct data analysis. Python is a general-purpose language, meaning it can be used to create a variety of different programs and isn't specialized for any specific problems.), thanks to my teachers I will keep on learning by coding though it seems hard, tedious and feel doubtful for me. My lab teacher showed me what and how to use variables: a named container for a particular set of bits or type of data (like integer, float, string etc...).  Forexample, x = 5​ y = "John"​ print(x)​ print(y). So in this context x and y are variables which are subject to change when required. In the future I will use python to code as many people recommend it's good for beginners. Along with this on my computer lab I participated on Video-graph: were 5 of my classmates gather each with a mobile phone and each of us started recording a video at the same time by framing one other person in our video the recording ends when one of us leave one of the frames then we Watched the videos together, later each of us placed our phone on the floor and pressed play,and then step back. Finally, I was assigned to record the video playing and posted it to the teams as bellow. I really liked and enjoyed it. Also I learned and wondered how Roman created the Video Graph an object-oriented programming concept that refers to the ability of a variable, function or object to take on multiple forms. A language that features polymorphism allows developers to program in the general rather than program in the specific.

On Marshmallow Challenge I learnt team work and how software prototype can be developed. This lab helped me to investigate and know the advantage of collaboration in creating new system as every group member will bring a different theory or idea of how the construction should be made. To achieve the best structure, more hands are better in maintaining the integrity of the structure and make life simple. Rather than working alone.  The image bellow reflects what we did as group in the class using marshmallow, 20 pasta, 1 metere string and 1 mtere packing tape in 18 minute time limit.

During my BigBlueButton video class, I coded using python koan on Visual Studio and experienced pair programming (an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently. While reviewing, the observer also considers the "strategic" direction of the work, coming up with ideas for improvements and likely future problems to address. This is intended to free the driver to focus all of their attention on the "tactical" aspects of completing the current task, using the observer as a safety net and guide. Another lesson I learnt is Polymorphism, an object-oriented programming concept that refers to the ability of a variable, function or object to take on multiple forms. A language that features polymorphism allows developers to program in the general rather than program in the specific.
Coding in Pythone Koan could be a typical example of An integrated development environment (IDE)-a software application that helps programmers develop software code efficiently. It increases developer productivity by combining capabilities such as software editing, building, testing, and packaging in an easy-to-use application.

OOP (Object-oriented programming) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods). A common feature of objects is that procedures (or methods) are attached to them and can access and modify the object's data fields. In this brand of OOP, there is usually a special name such as this or self used to refer to the current object. In OOP, computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another.[1][2] OOP languages are diverse, but the most popular ones are class-based, meaning that objects are instances of classes, which also determine their types. Many of the most widely used programming languages (such as C++, Java, Python, etc.) are multi-paradigm and they support object-oriented programming to a greater or lesser degree, typically in combination with imperative, procedural programming. Significant object-oriented languages include: Java, C++, C#, Python, R, PHP, Visual Basic.NET, JavaScript, Ruby, Perl, SIMSCRIPT, Object Pascal, Objective-C, Dart, Swift, Scala, Kotlin, Common Lisp, MATLAB, and Smalltalk. For instance,
#
Create a empty class
#
class Car:
#
pass
#
Instance of example
#
car1 = Car()
car2 = Car()
#
car1
<main.Car at 0x1ac92ea5760>

In conclusion, eventhough still the coding in python seems time taking to get use to it for me, I beleive I will make it happen. The only thing I am a kind of struggling is because I don't have enough time as I am working and studying fulltime.  So at this stage I don't assume my self as adeveloper yet, I need more effort. My personal strategy in studying is first I check for any kind of information on Canvas, teams and email, then I open multiple web browsers at one to help me research and explore. This strategy seems to work good for me so far though it slows the browsing. I am always eager to learn, appreciate, value creation and technology. I hadn't fought against technology rather I am curiouse how it is created. In time where I face difficulity I google about it. If I could send a time traveling text message back to myself at the start of this course, it could say spend more time to learn with IT experts one to one to know all about secreats of Computer softwares! Sometimes I feel like I can't make it happen but I take my time and initiatives to overcome my fear and work no matter what and accomplish my task. The hardest thing I have done was to pass my IELTS test because English is my second languge. Something kind that someone has done for me was my uncle who bought me my first mobile, I neverforget it. Something kind I have done for someone is that I sent money couple of times to my family and friends because they are stacked in a war in Tigray, Tigray is in acomplete blackout since November 2020 up to now.
